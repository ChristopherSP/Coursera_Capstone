IBM's professional data science course completion project

This project aims to practice modeling a real word problem, emulating most of the steps that a Data Scientists faces daily, starting up with getting data, exploring and visualizing it to understand the best course of action for making a model that gives the highest prediction accuracy and also makes sense and follows the theoretical assumptions presented in the dataset. Finally delivering a final report for peer review and evaluation for improvement.
